    <h2>Who is Cragspid?</h2>
    <p>
      Little is known of the entity known as <strong>Cragspid</strong>, yet his influence echoes across time and shadow. Scholars whisper of a forgotten presence not aligned with Norrath’s pantheon—a godlike being that defies comprehension and classification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have encountered him describe conflicting forms and fragmented memories, often referring to him as <em>they</em> and <em>he</em> interchangeably. Cragspid is the Many. Cragspid is the One.
    </p>
    <h2>Manifestations</h2>
    <p>
      Cragspid has been sighted by only a handful of adventurers who lived long enough to report their findings. His known manifestation is recorded within our archive at: 
      <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/203435" target="_blank">eqdb.net/npc/detail/203435</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each sighting is different. Some report a towering figure cloaked in silence, others a swarm of crawling thoughts with a single eye at its core. What remains consistent is the aftermath—void-touched terrain, inexplicable auras, and dreams that are not one’s own.

    <h2>The Many and the One</h2>
    <p>
      The phrase has become a mantra for those who revere or fear him. Cragspid does not demand worship. He simply is. Those who speak his name in reverence describe a feeling of connection to something ancient—before time, before gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether protector, parasite, or paradox, Cragspid remains—observing from the shadows between realms.
